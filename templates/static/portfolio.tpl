			<h1>Biography</h1>
				<br />
				<div class="message">My name is Ryein Cardale Goddard/Bowling.  I'm currently enrolled at Chemeketa Community College pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Information Systems.  I live in the great green state of Oregon.  The capital more precisely.  
				<br /><br />I am really interested in open software development. I enjoy tinkering with the latest electrics as well.  I am some what lucky being a Linux user.  All the software is usually developed for people in this category.
				<br /><br />I have experience in a few different fields so far and I enjoy sharing my experience with others either on IRC, or community forums.  I don't consider myself a web developer, but that is currently were most my experience is.
				<br /><br />Working on my certifications and degrees I plan on becoming a Network Administrator and possibly other things that interest me.
				<br /><br />Some of my other interests are in language and I am not talking about programming languages.  I am currently learning Japanese and plan on learning several other languages.
				<br /><br />I enjoy sports, but lean towards football and basketball mostly.  My favorite teams are the Seahawks and Trail-Blazers respectively.

			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
				<br />
				<cite>I have been working on a lot of little projects recently here and there.  I will try and keep an updated list for those that are interested.</cite>

			<h2>Java Projects</h2>
				<br />
					<h3>Anagram Sniper</h3>
						<br />
						<cite>I was playing a game with a friend of mine and kept getting my butt kicked so I did a little programming and kicked his right back...haha..let me know what you think.  There are several advantages with this program.  One you don't have to rely on the dictionary file provided if you don't want to.  Two if you speak another language then change the character file and the word file to create your own version of the Anagram Sniper specific to your language.

			<h1>My Very Beginning</h1>
			<ul>
				<cite>When I first started I was apart of a gaming group.  The gaming group didn\'t have a website or at least a very good one so I decided to try making one.  It just so happens the same time during high school I started a computer class that taught html.  Here is a short list of my incomplete history.  They are listed newest to oldest.</cite>

				<li>
				<a href="http://www.vampportal.kinggoddard.com">Vamp Portal</a> <cite>This was my first attempt at a large project.  I made it pretty far on my own steam, but as I developed my skills the mess became to much to control.  I eventually started over with my new skills and that is what you see now.  Magi Portal.</cite>
				</li>

				<li>
				<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/vampmodteam/">Gaming group</a> <cite>This is another one of my earlier websites I created.  This was after I discovered a few powerful tools.</cite>
				</li>

				<li>
				<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/vampmodteam/VAMPTESTPAGE.html">Never Used</a> <cite>Ugly site I never used.  I\'m not just showing you the good stuff.  I am showing it all.</cite>
				</li>

				<li>
				<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ego/s_industries/">First Attempt</a> <cite>This is a page I pretty much took off another website and modified.  Not something I do now without giving proper credit, but hey you have to learn some how.</cite>
